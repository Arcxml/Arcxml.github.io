🌟 I'm a second year undergraduate student from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, 3D Reconstruction, and machine learning.


🏆 I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liu](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/dongeliu/) of VADAR Lab.
